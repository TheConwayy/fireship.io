Devin Conway is a young developer that is based out of Michigan, USA.

He lives with his amazing mother, step-sister, dog and 2 cats. He is also starting courses to work towards his EMT license.

When he is not in school, hanging out with friends, or doing other, average, teenage activities, he is sitting down coding. Every single day he always tries his best to learn something new in the programming community since he has such a vast imagination.

Other than that, he is just your average - young - teenage boy.
